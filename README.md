“We win by making the bitcoin ecosystem win.” Obi Nwosu 

Fedi has full lightning network support & directly integrates webLN sites on the home page, allowing communities around the globe to connect with the best of bitcoin. 

Fedi Mods allow you to deploy your own WebLN enabled third-party applications, selected by guardians to curate customized experiences for members within their Federations. 

In the future these Mods will also integrate directly with Fedimint Modules and our chat framework to allow you to build extensible federated applications served directly from your community. 

Fedi Mods are sites that open within Fedi’s webview browser to guarantee webln support and direct integration with the wallet. 

Adding a new Mod website is as simple as linking the url, icon and name in your Fedimint config.  When the user enters the site they’ll be able to send/receive sats, login with lightning, and store/use L402 macaroons

Fedi will curate a collection of awesome WebLN sites and Mods which can be used through the Fedi App.
