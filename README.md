Every community is unique, each has it's own particular problems and that require unique solutions. We believe in taking a decentralised approach to this, so we've made Fedi easy for develpers to modify.

As a user of Fedi, you'll have acess right from the homepage to launch custom Fedi mods that interact with your money and data through open standards.

As a developer, we can make distribution easy. You no longer have to worry about finding an audience, funny urls or spending all your time on look and feel. Simply figure out the best way to solve the problem, keep it simple and deploy in Fedi.

- **Q:** Does Fedi act as a gatekeeper to Fedi mods?
- **A:** How little you know us! Fedi mods have been designed so that they can be deployed by guardians when configuring the federation, your community, your mods, your homepage.

Fedi mods provide a simple way to provide a unique experience for your local federation members, [all under your control](https://www.fedi.xyz/blog/we-can-build-our-own-future-fedi-gives-us-the-tools). 

## How it works

Fedi mods will be an evolving space over 2023 and we're keen to bring a whole communty along with us for the ride.

We will be publishing replit courses that will guide you through the development of fedi mods and take you on journey from code zero to hero!

Once you have your mods, let us know as we curate a collection of awesome webln sites and fedi-mods which can be used through the Fedi App. 

Fedi mod functionality will be released over three phases.

### Phase 1 - Open Lightning Standards (webln / LN URL Auth)

On release Fedi mods support open standards that allow you to write your own Fedi mods or integrate an existing app to Fedi. 

Accounts are managed from your exisitng fedi key (via LNURL-Auth), to ensure that when you restore oyu wallet you don't just restore your money and chat history, but also to every site you have an account on. 

To interact with your wallet, Fedi mods support simple WebLN integrations to move money to and from your favorite sites in seconds without copying and pasting invoices.

To get started you can deploy a simple website, integrate with webln and find a federation that wants to run it! 

### Phase 2 - Federation hosting

Websites are quick and easy, but not for every environemnt. Sometimes you don't want to rely on anyone else to run your app or the network conectivity just doesn't work out. 

Fedi mods can uniquely take advantage of the local infrastructure running the fedimint nodes to bring your mods to the Federation, running them locally in your community and under your control.

This allows oyu to operate a Federation with additional mods on a local only network or simply ensure that your data never leaves your control.  

### Phase 3 - Federation native APIs

As we move hosting towards the Federation we explore Federation native integration. This will allow you to natively access functionality running on the federation infrastructure such as core fedimint, chat bots, AI models and custom fedimint modules all from within your Fedi mod. 

Highly extensible federated applications served directly from your community, accessbile to every web developer on the planet. 

## Getting Started

The simplest way to get started now will be to develop your mods as simple webln apps and deploy to the Fedi Signet or in your own [Fedi Alpha federation](https://github.com/fedibtc/fedi-alpha).

## FAQs

#### What is webln?

Itâ€™s a library and set of specifications for lightning apps and client providers to facilitate communication between apps and users' lightning nodes in a secure way.

#### Are there design guidelines?

Fedi is a mobile application and loads you mods through a webview component so Fedi Sites should be designed to look and feel good on mobile and avoid to much superflous navitgation. Our advice would be to focus on a simple tightly scoped use case and avoid too much complexity - "whats the one highly valuable thign you can provide to Fedi users".

Over time we hope to develop and open source some design guidelines for the delivery of Fedi Mods and work collaboratively with these design communities and frontend developers to help adapt your webln sites to improve their UX for Fedi. 

#### How will we know what mods to build? 

We love connecting developers and designers with communities around the world to get insights to develop apps that meet real-world needs. 

We hope to build this bridge connecting developers to real-world needs and opportunities. Our Fedi Order can provide guidance on what they're hearing on the ground, what works, what doesn't, and connect you to audeinces that need your solutions.
